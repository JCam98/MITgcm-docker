# MITgcm-docker

This repository will provide support for researchers, scientists, and other members of the MITgcm climate science community to build and run models in portable units of software (docker containers). These units of software will effectively reduce time-intensive activities required by the end user such as determining necessary software tools to install, building skill sets in shell scripting and to an extent, navigating Linux environments, and will function as a one-stop-shop for all MITgcm-ECCO workflow tasks.
